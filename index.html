     <h1>My Tech Goals For The Next Two Years</h1>
      <p class="goals">
       As a beginner in the field of front-end development with only six months of experience, I am eager to continue learning and growing in my skills over the next two years. My goals are ambitious, yet achievable, and will help me become a goal driven front-end developer.<br>

       In the short term, my goal is to solidify my foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to master the basics of web development, including semantic HTML, responsive design, and JavaScript fundamentals. I plan to achieve this by completing online courses and coding challenges.Thankfully i also got admitted into a resourceful internship ,HNG.<br><br>

       Hopefully by the end of the first year, I aim to expand my skill set by learning popular front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React and Vue. I want to build complex web applications, including single-page applications and progressive web apps. I also plan to learn about state management, routing, and other advanced concepts.<br><br>

       In the second year, I aspire to become an expert in front-end development, with a focus on performance optimization, accessibility, and modern web technologies. I want to build a personal project that showcases my skills and contributes to the open-source community.<br>

       Additionally, I plan to stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices by attending conferences, meetups, and webinars. I also want to build a professional network of fellow developers and mentors who can guide and support me in my journey.

       Overall, my front-end tech goals for the next two years are focused on productivity,being a sucessful team player and being creative on set.
